  <introduction>
    <p>
        Geometrical construction is the process of creating geometric shapes, figures, or diagrams using basic tools, like a compass, ruler and protractor. The goal is to draw precise shapes without measurements, relying on rules of geometry. Examples of geometric constructions include drawing a line segment, bisecting an angle, or constructing a perpendicular e.t.c

                            Measuring angles is a significant topic in geometry. An angle can be measured using a protractor. An angle is measured in degrees, hence its called ‘degree measure’. One complete revolution is equal to <m>360</m> degrees, hence it is divided into <m>360</m> parts. Each part of the revolution is a degree. If we know how to measure angle, then it will be very easy to construct an angle using a protractor.

                            A protractor is a semi-circular tool used to draw and measure angles. It is marked with degrees from <m>0</m> to <m>180</m> degrees. It can be directly used to measure any angle from <m>0</m> to <m>360</m> degrees. The markings are made in two ways, <m>0</m> to <m>180</m> degrees from right to left and vice versa.

                                        The protractor has two ‘scales’ marked from <m>0</m> to <m>180</m> degrees on both the ends. Take the reading where <m>BC</m> coincides with the <m>0</m> degree.

                What is an angle bisector ?
            </p>

            <p>
                An angle bisector or the bisector of an angle is a line that divides an angle into two equal parts. For example, if a line <m>KM</m> divides an angle of <m>60</m> degrees into two equal parts, then each measure will be equal to <m>30</m> degrees.

            <p>
                Every angle has an angle bisector. It is also the line of symmetry between the two arms of an angle, the construction of which enables you to construct smaller angles. Say you are required to construct a <m>30°</m> angle. This can be performed by creating a <m>60°</m> angle and then bisecting it. Similarly, 90-degree, 45-degree, 15-degree and other angles are constructed using the concept of an angle bisector.

                    You require a ruler and a compass to construct angles and their bisectors. Given a known or unknown <m>\angle PQR</m>, the steps to construct its angle bisector are:

                        If an angle bisector divides an angle of <m>120</m> degrees, then what is the measure of each angle?

                </statement>
            </example>

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Given, a measure of an angle is <m>120</m> degrees
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As we know, the angle bisector divides the angle into equal two parts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Therefore, <m>120</m> degrees is divided into equal two parts, say <m>x</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    An equilateral triangle is a triangle that has all its sides equal in length. Also, the three angles of the equilateral triangle are equal to <m>60</m> degrees. The sum of all three angles of an equilateral triangle is equal to <m>180</m> degrees.  
                </p>

                <p>
                   <me>
                    60^\circ +60^\circ +60^\circ =180^\circ.
                   </me>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, it obeys the angle sum property of triangle. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The shape of an equilateral triangle is regular. The word ‘Equilateral’ is formed by the combination of two words, i.e., “Equi” meaning equal and “Lateral” meaning sides. An equilateral triangle is also called a regular polygon or regular triangle since all its sides are equal.

        <title>Constructing right-angled triangle</title>

        <introduction>
            <p>
                A right-angled triangle is a type of triangle that has one of its angles equal to 90 degrees. The other two angles sum up to 90 degrees. The sides that include the right angle are perpendicular and the base of the triangle. The third side is called the hypotenuse, which is the longest side of all three sides. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The three sides of the right triangle are related to each other. This relationship is explained by Pythagorean theorem.
