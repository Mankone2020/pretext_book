  "title": "Geometrical constructions",
  "body": " Geometrical constructions   Geometrical construction is the process of creating geometric shapes, figures, or diagrams using basic tools, like a compass, ruler and protractor. The goal is to draw precise shapes without measurements, relying on rules of geometry. Examples of geometric constructions include drawing a line segment, bisecting an angle, or constructing a perpendicular e.t.c    Measuring angles      Measuring angles is a significant topic in geometry. An angle can be measured using a protractor. An angle is measured in degrees, hence its called ‘degree measure’. One complete revolution is equal to degrees, hence it is divided into parts. Each part of the revolution is a degree. If we know how to measure angle, then it will be very easy to construct an angle using a protractor.    A protractor is a semi-circular tool used to draw and measure angles. It is marked with degrees from to degrees. It can be directly used to measure any angle from to degrees. The markings are made in two ways, to degrees from right to left and vice versa.        Suppose we have an angle to measure say, . Follow the steps given below to measure the angle.     Put the protractor above the line such that the midpoint of protractor is at point .    Adjust the protractor in such a way that is parallel to the straight-edge of the protractor.    The protractor has two ‘scales’ marked from to degrees on both the ends. Take the reading where coincides with the degree.    Now from degrees, check the line coincides with the curved edges of the protractor. This reading gives us the measure of angle .           Measure .          Align the protractor with the line as shown below. Start reading from the mark on the bottom-left of the protractor.       The number on the protractor that coincides with the second line is the measure of the angle. Measure the angle using the number on the top arc of the protractor.        Therefore, = Since the measure is greater than and lesser than , we can say that is an obtuse angle.    In triangle , use a protractor and measure .       Place the protractor baseline along the line and the center of the protractor at vertex . Observe the reading in the protractor which overlaps with line .     Answer: Therefore,     What is the angle formed at vertex of the square ?       Place the protractor center at vertex of the square and observe the reading.     Answer:       Bisecting angles   What is an angle bisector ?  An angle bisector or the bisector of an angle is a line that divides an angle into two equal parts. For example, if a line divides an angle of degrees into two equal parts, then each measure will be equal to degrees.     Every angle has an angle bisector. It is also the line of symmetry between the two arms of an angle, the construction of which enables you to construct smaller angles. Say you are required to construct a angle. This can be performed by creating a angle and then bisecting it. Similarly, 90-degree, 45-degree, 15-degree and other angles are constructed using the concept of an angle bisector.  Properties of Angle Bisector     All the points of angle bisector are equidistant from both the arms of the angle    An angle bisector can be drawn to any angle, such as acute, obtuse, or right angle    The angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite side in a ratio that is equal to the ratio of the other two sides        How to construct an angle bisector?  You require a ruler and a compass to construct angles and their bisectors. Given a known or unknown , the steps to construct its angle bisector are:        Place the compass pointer at and make an arc that cuts the two arms of the angle at two different points.       From the point where the first arc cut the arm , make another arc towards the interior of the angle.       Without changing the radius on the compass, repeat step from the point where the first arc cut .       Using a ruler, draw a line from to the point where the arcs intersect.        The line that was drawn through represents the angle bisector of the .  Note: If an angle bisector bisects a line segment at , it is known as the perpendicular bisector of that line.      What you need: A ruler, a pair of compasses and a protractor.  Explore   1.Draw angle ABC of any size. With point B as the centre and using a suitable radius, make arcs on line AB and BC as shown on the right. Label the points where the arcs meet lines AB and BC as M and N respectively.   explanetion     2.Using the same radius and with the points M and N as the centres, make arcs inside angle ABC to meet at point P as shown on the right.       3.Using a ruler, join B to P as shown below.      4.Measure angle ABP and PBC. What do you notice?  Connect.  The line that bisects an angle is called an angle bisector.      If an angle bisector divides an angle of degrees, then what is the measure of each angle?     Given, a measure of an angle is degrees  As we know, the angle bisector divides the angle into equal two parts.  Therefore, degrees is divided into equal two parts, say .

Constructing triangles   A triangle is a basic shape with three sides and three angles. The three sides of a triangle can have different lengths, and the angles can vary in size, but the sum of the angles in any triangle is always .  Types of Triangles  Triangles can be classified based on angles and sides.  (i) Classification of triangles Based on Sides      Scalene Triangle.    Equilateral Triangle.    Isosceles Triangle.         (ii) Classification of triangles Based on angles      Obtuse Triangle.    Acute triangle    Right-angled triange.           Constructing equalateral triangles   An equilateral triangle is a triangle that has all its sides equal in length. Also, the three angles of the equilateral triangle are equal to degrees. The sum of all three angles of an equilateral triangle is equal to degrees.     Thus, it obeys the angle sum property of triangle.  The shape of an equilateral triangle is regular. The word ‘Equilateral’ is formed by the combination of two words, i.e., “Equi” meaning equal and “Lateral” meaning sides. An equilateral triangle is also called a regular polygon or regular triangle since all its sides are equal.        Work in pairs  What you need: A ruler, a pair of compasses and a protractor.

Constructing isosceles triangle   An Isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two equal sides. Also, the two angles opposite the two equal sides are equal.     Properties of isosceles triangle.     As the two sides are equal in this triangle, the unequal side is called the base of the triangle    The angles opposite to the two equal sides of the triangle are always equal.    The altitude of an isosceles triangle is measured from the base to the vertex (topmost) of the triangle.        Work in pairs  1.Draw a straight line.

Constructing right-angled triangle   A right-angled triangle is a type of triangle that has one of its angles equal to 90 degrees. The other two angles sum up to 90 degrees. The sides that include the right angle are perpendicular and the base of the triangle. The third side is called the hypotenuse, which is the longest side of all three sides.  The three sides of the right triangle are related to each other. This relationship is explained by Pythagorean theorem.        Work in pairs  1.Draw a straight line of any length.
