An angle is represented by the symbol   Angles are formed when two lines intersect at point (also known as vertex ). In geometry, an angle is formed when two rays are joined at their endpoints. Rays are also known as sides or arms of the angle.  Observe the diagram below.   angles    lIne and intersect at point to form  , shaded in red.   Why angles?   Engineers use angles to design buildings, bridges, roads and stadia because they are an important factor in ensuring stability of buildings. Any inaccuracy may lead to unfortunate incidents like damages and collapse of buildings. Carpenters also use angles to make furnitutre.    True\/False definition of angles  Angles are formed when two rays intersect at a vertex.

An angle is represented by the symbol   Angles are formed when two lines intersect at point (also known as vertex ). In geometry, an angle is formed when two rays are joined at their endpoints. Rays are also known as sides or arms of the angle.  Observe the diagram below.   angles    lIne and intersect at point to form  , shaded in red.   Why angles?   Engineers use angles to design buildings, bridges, roads and stadia because they are an important factor in ensuring stability of buildings. Any inaccuracy may lead to unfortunate incidents like damages and collapse of buildings. Carpenters also use angles to make furnitutre.   "
