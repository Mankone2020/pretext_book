In latex , the siunitx  siunitx package  package siunitx  units package is loaded to achive unit handling. Since that package only offers SI units, some other common units will be added by PreTeXt in the preamble. In HTML, the capabilities of siunitx are simulated, weakly. Note that at present, you should not attempt to use the quantity element within a math environment.  The value of gravitational constant is  9.8  . Force is measured in   , also known as one   . A quantity with rather ridiculous units is  23  . One   is the same as   . You can have a unitless quantity, like  42  , which may help with consistency between such numbers and units in the latex output. Some non-SI units are available, such as the absurd   . The latex command \\pi is recognized within mag in conversions to HTML, which is consistent with the behavior with a conversion to latex , for example there are  2\\pi   in a full circle. This is a similar quantity with multiple occurences of \\pi to test a particular template used for HTML output. It is not meant to make any sense:  21\\pi45\\pi234\\pi890   .  For a full list of the allowed units and prefixes, see pretext-units.xsl . If you have a need for more units, they need to be added to pretext-units.xsl in the section that deals with units which are not part of siunitx by default. Note that the mag element should come first, followed by the unit element, followed by the per element.  "
